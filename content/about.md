## About Robert

Software Test Engineer with experience in the financial, medical, and technology sectors. Currently working at Sii Poland, where I am responsible for testing web and mobile applications, test automation in Java, and quality analysis of banking systems. Previously, I collaborated with companies such as Roche, as well as on projects focused on UX and digital usability.


My professional career began at the Government Protection Bureau, where I specialized in risk analysis, security, and international cooperation with domestic and foreign agencies. This experience shaped my precision, stress resilience, and ability to operate effectively in environments that demand the highest security standards.


I hold degrees from the University of International Relations and American Studies and the University of Economics and Innovation in Lublin. Currently, I am pursuing postgraduate studies in cybersecurity of information and telecommunication systems at the Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology in Warsaw, focusing on security testing as part of non-functional software quality characteristics.

I am the author of two educational applications designed to support the QA and cybersecurity communities:


- [CyberSecBook](https://cybersecbook.vercel.app/) — a self-developed knowledge repository on cybersecurity, featuring organized notes, penetration test reports, tutorials, and results of independent research.


- [FullStackQuality](https://fullstackquality.app/) — a comprehensive knowledge base for test automation, covering frameworks, documentation, research, and practical aspects of databases, version control systems, and terminal workflows — shared to foster the growth of the QA community.

I combine technical testing expertise with an empathetic approach to user experience. My main interests include software quality engineering, software architecture, and information system security. In my work, I value reliability, clear communication, and collaborative development.
